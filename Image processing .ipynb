For instance, various women’s movements frequently employ the colour pink in their written materials and pink hairstyles when performing demonstrations for abortion rights(Sutton and Vacarezza, 2020). Green was also noted to be commonly used in such protests. The colour purple was noted to be associated with gender-based violence protests.\n",

        "-\tCommitment to the movement (Mayhall,2005).\n",
